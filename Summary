Small description on the problem approach:
General -
Whole solution consist of an api route, which receives options, validates them.
A service that's responsible for filtering data.
On the client side,code that fetches the data and normalizes them.

Data -
To load and query data I used pandas library.
All needed data and some pre-calculated merged datasets are load
into memory on application start.

Testing -
Tests are mostly unit test for the options validation.

Errors -
Error handling is mostly on the api route options.
